# Objective:
Build an app that is functionally similar to this: https://javascript-calculator.freecodecamp.rocks/.
### More important requirements:
> User Story #13: If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered (excluding the negative (-) sign). For example, if 5 + * 7 = is entered, the result should be 35 (i.e. 5 * 7); if 5 * - 5 = is entered, the result should be -25 (i.e. 5 * (-5)).
### Made using React and Redux.
