### survey-form

### technical-documentation
> A [documentation-like webpage](https://codepen.io/mikapikafika/pen/XWoraaP), mainly revolving around fixed navbar element. Inspider by The Hitchhiker's Guide - but for Troubleshooting! (fun fact: all the text and images there were generated by AI)

### product-page
> A [product landing page](https://codepen.io/mikapikafika/pen/BavBddQ) with navbar, video and form elements. The Plant Whisperer (at this point every website I create has AI generated images).
