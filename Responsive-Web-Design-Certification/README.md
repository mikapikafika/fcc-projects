### survey-form
> A [survey](https://codepen.io/mikapikafika/pen/PoXYKJz) containing various input fields - checkboxes, radio buttons, text areas - as well as a dropdown menu. Inspired by the G.O.A.T. test from Fallout 3.

### tribute-page
> A [tribute page](https://codepen.io/mikapikafika/pen/oNJveZR) using HTML elements like main, figure, section and so on, this particular one dedicated to Spider-Verse animations.

### technical-documentation
> A [documentation-like webpage](https://codepen.io/mikapikafika/pen/XWoraaP), mainly revolving around fixed navbar element. Inspider by The Hitchhiker's Guide - but for Troubleshooting! (fun fact: all the text and images there were generated by AI)

### product-page
> A [product landing page](https://codepen.io/mikapikafika/pen/BavBddQ) with navbar, video and form elements. The Plant Whisperer (at this point every website I create has AI generated images).
