### survey-form

### technical-documentation
> A [documentation-like webpage](https://technical-documentation-1.mikapikafika.repl.co), mainly revolving around fixed navbar element. Inspider by The Hitchhiker's Guide - but for Troubleshooting! (fun fact: all the text and images there were generated by AI)

### product-page
