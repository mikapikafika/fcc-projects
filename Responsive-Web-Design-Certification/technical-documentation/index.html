                    Just when you're about to print an important document, your printer suddenly decides it's low on
                    ink. You question its timing, as you only replaced the cartridge yesterday. Fear not! A gentle shake
                    or a well-placed whack (figuratively, of course) can often convince the printer that it's mistaken.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Paper Jam Samba:</h4>
                    In the midst of printing a crucial report, your printer decides to engage in a whimsical dance
                    called the Paper Jam Samba. Sheets of paper twist and turn, refusing to feed properly, while the
                    printer insists on displaying error messages. Patiently follow the printer's instructions, remove
                    the offending paper, and the dance shall cease.

                rice and discover its surprising ability to save the day when technology goes awry.</p>
            <h2>Rice as a Moisture Absorber</h2>
            <p>Picture this: You accidentally spill a glass of water on your smartphone, and panic sets in. Instead of
                reaching for a conventional solution, consider the power of rice. Rice acts as a natural moisture
                absorber, helping to salvage water-damaged devices. Here's how you can put rice to work:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Remove the Device:</h4> If your device gets wet, promptly turn it off and remove any external
                    components,
                    such as the battery or SIM card, if possible. This helps minimize the risk of damage.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Bury It in Rice:</h4> Find a container or bag, fill it with uncooked rice, and bury your damp
                    device
                    within its grainy embrace. The rice will absorb excess moisture from the device over time. Leave it
                    in there for at least 24 to 48 hours.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Patience is Key:</h4> Resist the temptation to power on the device immediately. Allow it ample
                    time to
                    dry thoroughly before attempting to turn it back on. After the waiting period, remove the device
                    from its ricey bed and assess whether it's ready for action.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Unleashing the Power of Rice</h2>
            <p>Rice doesn't stop at moisture absorption. Let's explore a few more unconventional uses of rice in
                troubleshooting:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Rice for Sticky Keyboards:</h4> If your keyboard suffers from sticky or unresponsive keys, you
                    can employ
                    the magical properties of rice. Turn the keyboard upside down, gently shake it to remove loose
                    debris, and then place it in a container with rice. Let the rice work its absorbent wonders,
                    attracting any lurking particles and restoring your keyboard to its former glory.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Rice for Small Gadget Recovery:</h4> Ever dropped a small gadget, such as an earring or a tiny
                    screw,
                    into a difficult-to-reach place? Fear not! Take a nylon stocking, secure it over the end of a vacuum
                    cleaner hose with a rubber band, and vacuum the area where the item was lost. The rice's small,
                    granular nature can aid in capturing and retrieving the lost object.
                </li>

                    <h4>Look for the Exit Sign:</h4> Identify the conditions that should terminate the loop. Ensure that
                    the
                    loop's control variable eventually meets these conditions to break out of the infinite
                    cycle.<br><br>
                    <code><pre>
                        counter = 0
                        while counter < 10:
                            print("This loop will eventually end!")
                            counter += 1</pre>
                    </code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Strategically Placed Breaks:</h4> Insert appropriate break statements at crucial points within
                    the loop.
                    These will allow you to break free from the loop's gravitational pull when specific conditions are
                    met.<br><br>
                    <code><pre>
                        while True:
                        print("Looping endlessly...")
                        user_input = input("Do you want to break the loop? (yes/no): ")
                        if user_input.lower() == "yes":
                            print("Loop broken! Freedom at last!")
                            break</pre>
                    </code>
                </li>
            </ol>
